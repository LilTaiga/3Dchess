# 3Dchess
Me and my friends had the idea to try to create a 3D chess game in Unity.

This is our current progress:
- [x] Discuss the rules for each piece movement
- [x] Write the rules for the moveset for each piece (Can be found in "moveset.md")
- [x] Plan how the game structure will work
- [x] Create a class diagram
- [ ] Code the basic structure of a functional chess board
- [ ] Code the movement of each piece
- [ ] Finish the coding for the chess board

More to be added later.
